## 🔧 Deployment Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues during deployment:

1. **Permission Denied Error**:
    - Ensure `render.yaml` uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
    - Check that environment variables are properly set

2. **Build Warnings Treated as Errors**:
    - The `.env` file sets `CI=false` to prevent this
    - Alternatively, set `CI=false` in your deployment platform's environment variables

3. **Static File Serving**:
    - Make sure `homepage: "."` is set in `package.json`
    - Ensure proper routing configuration for single-page applications
