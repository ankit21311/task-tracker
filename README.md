## 🌐 Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on various platforms:

### Render.com

- Uses `render.yaml` configuration file
- Automatically builds and deploys from GitHub
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Includes fallback build commands for permission issues

### Netlify

- Can be deployed by connecting your GitHub repository
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `build`

### Vercel

- Can be deployed using Vercel CLI or GitHub integration
- Zero configuration deployment for React apps

## 🔧 Deployment Troubleshooting

### Common "Permission Denied" Error Fix

If you encounter the `react-scripts: Permission denied` error on Render:

1. **Updated Build Configuration**:
   - The `render.yaml` now includes permission fixes and fallback commands
   - Uses `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/* 2>/dev/null || true` to set permissions
   - Falls back to `npx react-scripts build` if the standard build fails

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```yaml
   envVars:
     - key: CI
       value: false
     - key: GENERATE_SOURCEMAP
       value: false
     - key: NODE_VERSION
       value: 20
   ```

3. **Multi-Step Build Command**:
   ```bash
   npm install --no-optional &&
   chmod +x node_modules/.bin/* 2>/dev/null || true &&
   npm run build || npx react-scripts build
   ```

### Other Common Issues:

1. **Build Warnings Treated as Errors**:
   - The `.env` file sets `CI=false` to prevent this
   - Environment variables in `render.yaml` override this setting

2. **Node.js Version Issues**:
   - Updated to Node.js 20 (current LTS)
   - `.nvmrc` file specifies the version
   - `NODE_VERSION` environment variable ensures consistency

3. **Static File Serving**:
   - Make sure `homepage: "."` is set in `package.json`
   - Proper routing configuration for SPA in `render.yaml`

## 💡 Usage Instructions

1. **Login**: Enter your name on the welcome screen
2. **Add Task**: Click "Add New Task" and fill out the form
3. **Edit Task**: Click the "Edit" button on any task
4. **Complete Task**: Check the checkbox to mark as completed
5. **Delete Task**: Click "Delete" and confirm the action
6. **Filter Tasks**: Use the filter tabs to view different task states
7. **Track Progress**: Monitor your completion rate in the dashboard
